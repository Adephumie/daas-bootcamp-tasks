# Understanding ClusterRole, Role, RoleBinding, and ClusterRoleBinding in Kubernetes

## ClusterRole
A ClusterRole is a set of permissions that can be applied to resources within a cluster. It allows for the definition of permissions on a cluster level. It can be used to define permissions for non-namespaced resources or be used within RoleBindings or ClusterRoleBindings.

## Role
A Role is similar to a ClusterRole but is specific to a single namespace. It defines a `set of permissions` that apply to resources within a `single namespace`. Roles are used to define permissions within a specific scope.

## RoleBinding
A RoleBinding grants the permissions defined in a Role to a user or set of users. It binds a Role to a user or a set of users within a specific namespace. It allows you to control access to resources within a namespace.

## ClusterRoleBinding
A ClusterRoleBinding, like RoleBinding, grants the permissions defined in a ClusterRole. However, it applies these permissions across the entire cluster rather than within a single namespace. It is used to grant the same permissions defined in a ClusterRole to a user or set of users across the entire cluster.

### Desired Results for Different Combinations

- ClusterRole + RoleBinding: This combination would grant permissions defined in the ClusterRole to specific users within a particular namespace.
- ClusterRole + ClusterRoleBinding: This combination would grant the permissions defined in the ClusterRole to specific users across the entire cluster.
- Role + RoleBinding: This combination would grant permissions defined in the Role to specific users within a particular namespace.
- Role + ClusterRoleBinding: This combination wouldn't be valid since Role is specific to a single namespace, and ClusterRoleBinding applies permissions cluster-wide.
