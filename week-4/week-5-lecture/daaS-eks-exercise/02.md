# ConfigMaps

A ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. However, it does not provide secrecy or encryption. 

## Ways to Use ConfigMaps

There are four different ways that you can use a ConfigMap to configure a container inside a Pod:

1. Inside a container command and args
2. Environment variables for a container
3. Add a file in read-only volume, for the application to read
4. Write code to run inside the Pod that uses the Kubernetes API to read a ConfigMap

## Creating Immutable ConfigMaps

You can create an immutable ConfigMap by setting the `immutable` field to `true`.

**Caution:** It is important to note that ConfigMaps do not provide secrecy or encryption, and thus should not be used to store confidential information.
