# Secrets in Kubernetes

A Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key. However, it's crucial to note that Kubernetes Secrets are, by default, stored unencrypted in the API server's underlying data store (etcd).

The Secret resource contains two maps: `data` and `stringData`. The `data` field is used to store arbitrary data, encoded using base64. The `stringData` field is provided for convenience, and it allows you to provide the same data as unencoded strings.

You can make your data "hidden" by defining a key that begins with a dot or remove the dot to make it visible.

## Types of Secret

| Built-in Type                  | Usage                                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Opaque                         | arbitrary user-defined data                        |
| kubernetes.io/service-account-token | ServiceAccount token                            |
| kubernetes.io/dockercfg        | serialized ~/.dockercfg file                       |
| kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson | serialized ~/.docker/config.json file              |
| kubernetes.io/basic-auth       | credentials for basic authentication               |
| kubernetes.io/ssh-auth         | credentials for SSH authentication                 |
| kubernetes.io/tls              | data for a TLS client or server                    |
| bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token  | bootstrap token data                               |

## Using Secrets

- Using Secrets as environment variables: use `env[].valueFrom.secretKeyRef` field.
- Using Secrets as files from a Pod.
- Using `imagePullSecrets`.

**Caution:** Handle sensitive information carefully. Ensure that sensitive data is properly secured and managed, especially in production environments.# Secrets in Kubernetes
