Introduction to Kubernetes part 1


Question 1:

Objective: Create a basic Kubernetes service using NodePort.

Scenario: You have a simple web application running in a Kubernetes pod. 
Your task is to expose this application to the external world using a NodePort service.

Steps:

-Create a YAML file for a pod named "web-app-pod" running a web server container with the image "nginx:latest."
-Deploy the pod to the cluster.
-Create a NodePort service named "web-app-service" to expose the pod on a specific port, e.g., 31000.
-Ensure the service is accessible from outside the cluster.


Question 2:

Objective: Set resource requests and limits for a Kubernetes deployment.

Scenario: You have a Kubernetes deployment named "my-app-deployment" running a critical application. 
To ensure resource utilization, you need to configure resource requests and limits.

Steps:

-Describe the current state of the "my-app-deployment" deployment to check for any existing 
resource requests and limits.
-Modify the deployment YAML file to set resource requests for CPU to "100m" and memory to "128Mi" for 
the application containers.
-Set resource limits for CPU to "200m" and memory to "256Mi."
-Apply the changes to the deployment.
-Verify that the resources are configured correctly for the containers in the "my-app-deployment."
