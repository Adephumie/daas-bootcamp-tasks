Introduction to Kubernetes part 1

Question 1:
You are tasked with deploying a web application in your Kubernetes cluster. 
The application consists of a frontend pod and a backend pod. 
The frontend should be accessible only within the cluster, and the backend needs 
to be accessible from outside the cluster. 
Create the necessary Kubernetes resources to achieve this, making use of ClusterIP and NodePort services. 
Additionally, ensure that these resources are organized within a dedicated namespace 
called "name-of-your-team_daasbootcamp".

Question 2:
Imagine you have a Kubernetes cluster where you are hosting multiple microservices 
within different namespaces. Each microservice requires a specific amount of CPU and memory resources. 
You need to demonstrate resource management by setting resource requests and limits for the pods in 
the "production" namespace. Choose one of the microservices (e.g., "frontend") and define the 
appropriate resource requests and limits for its pods. 
Explain the rationale behind your resource allocation decisions and how these settings impact pod behavior.
