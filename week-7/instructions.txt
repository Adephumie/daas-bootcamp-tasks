Assessment 1: Basic TeamCity CI/CD Understanding

Objective: To assess your basic understanding of setting up a TeamCity CI/CD pipeline from 
Bitbucket to build a Docker image and push it to DockerHub.

Task 1: Multiple Choice Questions

1. What does CI/CD stand for? a) Computer Intelligence/Continuous Deployment 
b) Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery c) Code Integration/Delivery 
d) Continuous Iteration/Delivery

2. In the context of TeamCity, what is a "build configuration"? a) A list of all team members 
b) A Dockerfile c) A set of build steps and settings d) A Git repository

3. What is the purpose of a CI/CD pipeline? a) To create Docker containers 
b) To automate the software delivery process c) To perform code reviews d) To monitor server health

4. Which version control system is commonly integrated with TeamCity for source code 
management? a) Subversion b) Mercurial c) CVS d) All of the above

Task 2: Fill in the Blanks

Complete the following sentences:

1. In TeamCity, a ___ is a machine or environment where the actual build process is executed.

2. A ______ in TeamCity defines the source code repository and its connection details, 
allowing TeamCity to fetch the source code.

3. The ___ are files and data generated during a build, such as compiled binaries, that can be 
stored and used for deployment or other purposes.

4. TeamCity provides a _ feature that allows you to track and review the results of previous build runs.

5. Build _ in TeamCity are responsible for initiating a build when certain conditions, like code 
changes, are detected.

6. TeamCity allows you to define build ___ to customize various aspects of the build process, 
like compiler flags or version numbers.

7. In a TeamCity build configuration, a build _ specifies a particular task or operation to be 
performed during the build process.

8. The build _ in TeamCity is where builds wait to be executed on an available build agent.

9. TeamCity provides build __ to create a reusable configuration for building different projects 
with similar build requirements.

10. TeamCity can be integrated with various version control systems (VCS) like __, _, __, and ______ 
to manage and track the source code used in the build process.

Assessment 2: TeamCity CI/CD Implementation

Objective: To assess your ability to set up a TeamCity CI/CD pipeline from Bitbucket/Github
to build a Docker image and push it to DockerHub.

Task 1: Practical Implementation

Instructions:

Create a new Bitbucket/GitHub repository containing a simple web application. You can use any 
programming language or framework.

Set up a TeamCity server and configure it to monitor the Bitbucket repository.

Create a TeamCity build configuration that performs the following steps:

-Build the web application. 
-Run unit tests. 
-Create a Docker image from the application. 
-Push the Docker image to DockerHub. 
-Document the entire process with step-by-step instructions and configuration files. 
Your documentation should be detailed enough for someone else to recreate the pipeline.

Task 2: Troubleshooting and Optimization

In this task, you will need to troubleshoot build issues and create a TeamCity Pipeline

Instructions:

Make reference to the nodeexpressApp in this same folder, there is an issue with building an image from the docker file. You need to troubleshoot and figure out the issue; then proceed to build a pipeline and push the image to dockerHub.

Suggest one or more optimizations for the CI/CD pipeline to make it more efficient or reliable.

Provide a before-and-after comparison of the pipeline's performance, such as build time or resource utilization, after implementing the optimizations.

These assessments will help you gauge your understanding of TeamCity CI/CD and their ability to apply the knowledge to real-world scenarios.
